# GPU Status

## System
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 (8GB)
- **Driver**: 581.15 (CUDA 13.0)
- **Python**: 3.11
- **TensorFlow**: 2.20.0 (CPU-only)

## Issue
TensorFlow dropped native Windows GPU support after Python 3.10. Your RTX 3070 works (verified with `nvidia-smi`) but TensorFlow 2.20+ on Windows Python 3.11 can't use it.

## Current Setup: CPU-Optimized
Your notebook is now optimized for CPU training:
- **oneDNN** enabled for fast CPU ops
- **Auto-threading** configured
- **Larger batch size** (2048) for CPU efficiency
- **Training time**: ~10-15 seconds (fast enough for this dataset)

## GPU Options (if needed later)

### Option 1: WSL2 (Recommended)
```bash
wsl --install
# Inside WSL:
pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]
```

### Option 2: Google Colab
- Upload notebook to https://colab.research.google.com
- Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU (T4)
- Free, works immediately

### Option 3: Python 3.10
```bash
# Install Python 3.10, then:
pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.10.1
```

### Option 4: Docker
```bash
docker run --gpus all -it tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu
```

## Verdict
**Your current CPU setup is fine.** The model trains in ~10s on CPU. Only switch to GPU if you:
- Train much larger models
- Need 10x+ speedup
- Process huge datasets regularly
